Carrot in a Box game. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects” 

“Carrot in a Box” is a simple and silly game for two human players. Each player has a box. One box has a carrot in it, and each player wants to have the carrot. The boxes and carrot are displayed in ASCII art. The first player looks in their box and then tells the second player they either do or don’t have the carrot. The second player gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
